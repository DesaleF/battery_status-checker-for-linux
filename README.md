# battery_status-checker-for-linux
it is created for linux os, to get notification before improper 
shutdown for computer with dead batteries

# To run/test it, 
run the program then give it the minimum battery level at which the computer shutdowns improperly.
for example: my laptop shutdown with out any notification at 50%, since my battery is damagged by over charging. I will run the jar file and give the battery level 60. finally I will be notified at 60% of the battery level, and I will save everything or I will sleep the laptop before improper shutdown.
